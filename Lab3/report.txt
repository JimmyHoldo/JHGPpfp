We ran our test on two computers in the school. The computers have a 4-core Intel i5-3470S processor with one node on each computer.
The choice to only have one node on every machine was because we started "erlang:system_info(schedulers)-1)" processes on every node and therefore more nodes than one on each machine would lead to more interleaving between processes.
